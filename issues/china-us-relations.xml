                    <p> A ship called the <hi rend="italic">Empress of China</hi> became the first
                        vessel to sail from the United States to China, arriving in Guangzhou
                        (Canton) in August. The vessel’s supercargo, Samuel Shaw, had been appointed
                        as an unofficial consul by the U.S. Congress, but he did not make contact
                        with Chinese officials or gain diplomatic recognition for the United States.
                        Since the 1760s all trade with Western nations had been conducted at
                        Guangzhou through a set group of Chinese merchants with official licenses to
                        trade. Some residents of the American colonies had engaged in the China
                        trade before this time, but this journey marked the new nation’s entrance
                        into the lucrative China trade in tea, porcelain, and silk. </p>

                    <p> British merchants, seeking a commodity to trade for Chinese goods, began to
                        smuggle Indian opium into China. Seeing that this raised the profit margins
                        of the British, most American firms followed suit, although most obtained
                        their opium from Persia, rather than India. </p>

                        on the American vessel threw a pitcher overboard that struck her, knocking
                        her out of her small boat into the water, where she drowned. Local
                        authorities demanded that the guilty party be surrendered for trial and
                        punishment, but at first the ship’s captain and other merchants refused to
                        comply. However, when it became clear that their resistance was damaging
                        trade, the Americans relented and offered up an Italian crewman named
                        Terranova. Soon thereafter, Terranova was executed, and trade resumed. </p>

                        Abeel. They reached Guangzhou in February of 1830. Bridgman was one of the
                        first Americans to undertake the study of China’s history and culture, and
                        also wrote a Chinese language history of the United States. </p>

                        officials. When it lost its charter and dissolved in 1834, the trade at
                        Guangzhou opened up to more private traders. This destabilized trade
                        relations over the next few years, but American merchants benefited from the

                        Dunn returned from China with an enormous collection of art, artifacts,
                        botanical samples, and other items. In 1839 he put them on display in his
                        native city in a “Chinese Museum” that was designed to present the items in
                        as natural a manner as possible, so as to give visitors a picture of life in
                        China. Over 100,000 people visited the exhibit before he moved it to London
                        in 1841. </p>

                    <p> In 1838 the Chinese Emperor sent Commissioner Lin Zexu to Guangzhou, with a
                        goal to stamp out the opium trade. Lin demanded that the British merchants
                        surrender their supplies of opium for destruction, and after an initial
                        refusal they agreed to do so, after which they left Guangzhou for Macao. The
                        following year, the dispute over these actions exploded into war. While the
                        British traders were temporarily absent from Guangzhou, Americans did
                        exceptionally good business, some of it on contract for the British. </p>

                        negotiated with the Qing Government to sign the Treaty of Nanjing. This
                        treaty ended the existing system of trade through officially licensed
                        merchants, opened four new treaty ports to trade (including Shanghai),
                        granted most favored nation status to Britain, and provided the basis for
                        the expansion of trade. It served as the model for subsequent treaties
                        between China and other Western nations. </p>

                    <p> In 1843, Secretary of State Daniel Webster sent Caleb Cushing to China as
                        Minister Plenipotentiary to negotiate a treaty with the Qing. Cushing hoped
                        to journey to Beijing to conduct these negotiations, but the Qing refused to
                        grant an imperial audience, which delayed the negotiations. He thus spent
                        several months waiting in Macao for permission to travel to Beijing before
                        finally giving up on that hope. Once he did so, the Qing negotiator, Qi
                        Ying, quickly agreed to all the American terms (which were mostly the same
                        as the British) and the two countries signed a treaty. The terms included
                        extraterritoriality for U.S. citizens in China, most favored nation status,
                        and a guarantee for treaty revision in twelve years. This marked the
                        beginning of official diplomatic relations between the United States and

                    <p> The first ship carrying Chinese laborers, known as “coolies,” arrived in
                        Cuba with workers for the sugar plantations. Soon thereafter, coolie traders
                        began to dock at U.S. ports, prompting the U.S. Congress to pass a law
                        prohibiting U.S. citizens from engaging in the trade and guaranteeing the
                        freedom of all Chinese laborers who came to the United States. After the
                        California Gold Rush broke out in 1849, more and more Chinese laborers
                        arrived to work in mines, on railroads, and in other mostly menial tasks.
                        Over 100,000 Chinese came to the United States within the first 20 years.

                        Anson Burlingame to head the mission. With permission from the U.S.

                        train Chinese to work as diplomats and technical advisors to the government.
                        He brought a group of 30 students, all teenaged males, from China to the

                        American families. The Qing ended the program in 1881, due to rising
                        anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States, fears that the students were
                        becoming too Americanized, and frustration that they were not being granted
                        the promised access to U.S. military academies. Before the program ended,
                        about 120 students took part, and some chose not to return to China. </p>

                    <p> After more than a decade of anti-Chinese lobbying, mostly from the West
                        Coast, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, and it was signed by
                        President Chester A. Arthur. The Act suspended Chinese immigration to the
                        United States for ten years, which violated the spirit, if not the letter,
                        of the 1868 treaty. In recent years several attempts had been made to pass a
                        similar bill, but prior Presidents had vetoed them because they had
                        contravened the existing agreements with China. This marked the beginning of
                        some sixty years of exclusion. </p>

                    <p> Early in 1888, the United States and China signed the Bayard-Zhang Treaty,
                        by which the Qing agreed to prohibit all new Chinese migration for 20 years
                        and limited the classes of Chinese who could return to the United States
                        after a trip home. The agreement did not violate the Burlingame Treaty of
                        1868 because the United States did not institute the prohibitions, but it
                        drew opposition from the Chinese populace. However, before the treaty was
                        ratified, Congress passed the Scott Act, which canceled the right of return
                        for Chinese residents who left the United States for any reason. Chinese in
                        the United States challenged the Act as being unconstitutional because it
                        contravened prior treaties, but with no success. The California Circuit
                        Court ruled that Congress could modify any treaty at any time, and the
                        Supreme Court found that, although the Scott Act did contravene the
                        treaties, control over immigration was a sovereign right and thus Congress
                        had the authority to act as it saw fit regardless of any international
                        agreements. This position stood in stark contrast to the U.S. insistence on
                        extraterritorial rights and trading privileges in China that had been
                        enshrined in prior treaties. </p>

                        gained several new privileges in China including the right to build
                        factories. The United States gained this right as well, through the most

                    <p> A group of reform-minded Chinese literati became concerned that China was in

                        the government and educational system. They joined with the Guangxu Emperor
                        in an effort to bring about change, but conservatives within the imperial
                        court, including the Empress Dowager Ci Xi, opposed these measures. They
                        seized the Emperor and placed him under house arrest and arrested and
                        executed several literati while others fled into exile. There was no

                        in China made treaty revision much less likely in the near future. </p>

                    <p> In September 1899 and July 1900, Secretary of State John Hay issued the two
                        Open Door Notes to all foreign powers with interests in China. The United
                        States had become concerned over recent developments in China, where many
                        foreign powers had claimed exclusive spheres of influence. Fearful that the
                        long-standing free trade system in China would be compromised and that a
                        weakening China might be carved up like Africa had been, Hay acted to defend
                        U.S. interests in the area. The Notes aimed to preserve both the existing
                        system of trade, with equal opportunity for all foreign powers, and to
                        maintain China’s territorial integrity so that no foreign power would have
                        an advantage. This was the first clear and official statement of U.S. China
                        policy. </p>

                    <p> In the late 19th century, anti-foreign sentiments merged with rural unrest
                        and mystical cults to give rise to the Boxer movement. Practicing martial
                        arts and espousing a slogan of “support the Qing, destroy the foreign,” the
                        “Boxers United in Righteousness” targeted all foreigners and Chinese
                        Christian converts, who suffered violent attacks. The Uprising reached a
                        peak in the spring and summer of 1900 when Boxer forces marched on Beijing,
                        with the support of the Qing court. For two months the Boxers occupied the
                        capital and besieged the foreign legation district, where the foreign
                        community and a large group of Chinese Christians barricaded themselves
                        within the legations. The foreigners managed to resist repeated Boxer
                        attacks until a multinational force finally fought its way in from the coast
                        and reached Beijing, lifting the siege. U.S. marines played a key role in
                        defending the legations during the siege and also joined the multinational
                        force that crushed the Boxers. </p>

                    <p> The U.S. Congress continued to pass restrictive legislation regarding
                        Chinese immigration; new laws aimed both at preventing the arrival of more
                        Chinese and establishing guidelines for the ultimate removal of all of those
                        already in the United States. These exclusionary laws contributed to the
                        ghettoization of Chinese communities in the United States as Chinese become
                        more and more concentrated in insular Chinatowns in major urban areas across

                        launched boycotts of U.S. products and businesses. Some of the inspiration
                        for the boycotts came from Chinese living in the United States, but the
                        primary motivation was the nationalism that was rising in China. </p>

                        first country to do something of this kind, and in response, the Qing
                        decided to send between 50 and 100 students a year to receive their
                        education in the United States. Secretary of State Elihu Root determined
                        that the remitted funds would be used to finance this educational program.

                        constitutional changes, but these measures proved to be too little, too
                        late. Discontent with the government rose, and when the Qing attempted to
                        nationalize all of the regional railroads, and took out more foreign loans
                        to do so, it proved to be the breaking point. An uprising broke out in the
                        inland city of Wuhan in October, and within a few months local rebellions
                        took place throughout the country. These eventually led to the fall of the

                        control, had himself proclaimed Emperor in 1916, but soon thereafter he
                        passed away. The following year, China fragmented into territorial fiefdoms
                        ruled by local warlords, with a nominal national regime located in Beijing.
                        The United States maintained diplomatic relations with this Government, but
                        U.S. citizens and companies in China often dealt directly with local
                        leaders. </p>

                    <p> China had joined the Allies in World War I, partly at U.S. President Woodrow
                        Wilson’s urging, and hoped that in return it would regain control over the
                        former German concessions that Japan had seized. However, this hope was not
                        fulfilled by the Treaty of Versailles, due mostly to secret agreements
                        between Japan, Britain, and France to give those territories to Japan. When
                        word of this reached China, on May 4 students gathered for a demonstration
                        at the Tiananmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace) in Beijing, and then stormed the
                        house of a pro-Japanese minister, to express their discontent. This launched
                        the May Fourth Movement, a mostly urban movement that combined cultural and
                        educational reform with rising nationalism and a new energy for thorough
                        political and social transformation. Although some felt betrayed by Wilson
                        for not fulfilling his promises to promote self-determination, many Chinese
                        looked to the United States for models of reform. </p>

                        installed the last Qing Emperor, Puyi, as ruler of the puppet state of
                        Manzhouguo (Manchukuo). The League of Nations sent the Lytton Commission,

                        left the League of Nations in 1933. The United States separately criticized

                        turned into full-scale war. The Japanese Army swept down from Manchuria and
                        along the coast to Shanghai, where Chinese troops put up a spirited defense
                        before finally giving way. The Japanese military then pushed inland, with
                        their assault reaching a destructive peak in the Rape of Nanjing in

                        disagreed over strategy, troop deployments, and expenditures. Material aid
                        from the United States was limited by the difficulty of getting supplies to
                        Chongqing, particularly after Japan seized control of Burma from Britain in
                        May and cut the Burma Road that had been China’s lifeline. Thereafter, U.S.
                        pilots flew supplies in over “the Hump” from India. </p>

                        pushed to have China declared a major power in any postwar settlement, and
                        also promised that China would gain sovereignty over all areas seized by

                        went to the Communist base camp at Yan’an to explore the possibility of U.S.
                        aid to Communist forces. The group, which maintained a presence there from
                        July 1944 to March 1947, was on the whole favorably impressed with the
                        discipline and organization of the Communists, and sought to provide direct
                        assistance. However, Jiang objected to this, as did U.S. Special Envoy

                        long-simmering disputes erupt again. In December, President Harry S. Truman
                        sent General George Marshall as a Special Envoy to negotiate an agreement
                        between the two sides on a cease-fire and a national unity government. These
                        agreements quickly collapsed, and the Marshall Mission ultimately failed as
                        full-scale civil war began in early 1946. </p>

                        of others in the Truman administration, who saw the Nationalists as a lost

                        establishment of the PRC on October 1. Before this, U.S. Ambassador John
                        Leighton Stuart met with Communist leaders to discuss U.S. recognition of
                        the PRC, but those talks failed when Mao announced his intention to lean
                        towards the side of the Soviet Union. The Department of State issued the
                        China White Paper, which stated that the United States had stayed out of the
                        Chinese civil war because it neither should nor could have influenced the
                        outcome. The Truman administration was prepared to abandon the Nationalists,
                        allow the Communists to take over Taiwan, and perhaps even grant recognition
                        to PRC. </p>

                    <p> Soon after the start of the Korean War, General Douglas MacArthur led U.S.
                        forces across the 38th Parallel and drove north towards China, which brought
                        China into the conflict and precipitated the first military clash between
                        U.S. and Chinese forces since the Boxer Uprising of 1900. With the United
                        States and China engaged in combat, anti-American sentiment rose in China
                        and almost all remaining U.S. citizens began to pull out. The Truman
                        administration changed its earlier China policy and sent the Seventh Fleet
                        into the Taiwan Straits to prevent the PRC from launching an attack to
                        reclaim Taiwan. With McCarthyism on the rise in the United States, a debate
                        began over who had “lost China,” and many intellectuals, journalists, and
                        others with connections to China came under suspicion and even attack. </p>

                        Thereafter, the Korean conflict stalemated at roughly the pre-war boundary,
                        although it was not until 1953 that the various parties signed an armistice
                        agreement. </p>

                        organizing the countryside into massive communes that would produce both
                        food and iron and steel. After one year of bumper crops, agricultural output
                        in some areas plummeted, although reports continued to trumpet high
                        productivity. Devastating famines ensued, and rural production of iron and
                        steel in “backyard furnaces” did not meet the targets for industrial
                        production, leading to the near collapse of the Chinese economy by 1962.

                    <p> After 15 years of providing major economic assistance to the Nationalist
                        regime on Taiwan, the U.S. Government halted this type of support in
                        recognition of the growth and stability of Taiwan’s economy. </p>

                    <p> With speeches to students gathered in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, Mao
                        launched the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, unleashing a decade of
                        often destructive mass-mobilization. Bands of student-aged Red Guards were
                        at the vanguard of the movement, which quickly descended into chaos. In
                        1967, a group of radicals took over and temporarily shut down the Foreign
                        Ministry, forcing the PRC’s foreign relations to a halt for several months.
                        By 1968, the PRC Government had reined in the worst excesses, and it
                        controlled the urban chaos by sending urban youths to the countryside for
                        re-education. </p>

                    <p> In the wake of the stunning Tet Offensive in Vietnam in early 1968, the
                        anti-war movement in the United States gained strength and President Lyndon
                        Johnson began to seriously explore possibilities for withdrawing from
                        Vietnam. In the fall, Richard Nixon was elected President partly on the
                        strength of his claim that he would get the United States out of Vietnam.

                        broke into localized armed conflict, heightening tensions between the two.
                        This conflict bolstered the Nixon Administration in its intention to improve
                        relations with the PRC in order to isolate and pressure the Soviet Union.

                        example of reducing military commitments, the U.S. Navy ceased making
                        regular patrols of the Taiwan Strait. </p>

                        Americans there in two decades, and soon thereafter the United States eased
                        trade and travel restrictions with China. The Chinese ping-pong team came to

                        of state ever to set foot on the Chinese Mainland. Nixon, Kissinger, and
                        others met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and at the end of the weeklong

                        in health. Zhou rehabilitated Deng Xiaoping, who had been purged in 1966, to
                        serve as his Deputy Premier and handle some aspects of relations with the
                        United States. These leadership shifts delayed the normalization process.

                        Cooperation (APEC) that allowed China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong to join as
                        separate economies rather than separate states. </p>

                    <p> The first high-level contacts in several years occurred when President
                        George H.W. Bush and Chinese Premier Li Peng met on the sidelines of a U.N.
                        conference. At the same time, President Bush maintained support for Taiwan
                        by authorizing new arms sales and dispatching a Special Trade Representative
                        to the island. </p>

                    <p> President Clinton tied the annual review of Most Favored Nation trading
                        status to China’s record on human rights, a decision that was in keeping
                        with popular opinion on China. When this status came up for renewal the next
                        year, Clinton reversed this position and granted China MFN without requiring
                        any changes regarding human rights. </p>

                        warnings from the United States. As tensions rose, the United States sent
                        two carrier battle groups into the Strait, which may have helped calm the
                        situation. Lee Teng-hui was re-elected President in Taiwan’s first ever
                        direct presidential election. </p>

                        paid a return trip to China for a summit meeting. During his visit, he
                        stated that the United States held to a “three no’s policy” regarding
                        Taiwan. By this he meant that the United States does not support Taiwan’s
                        independence, “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan” policies, or Taiwan’s
                        membership in international organizations where statehood is required. </p>

                        Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing three and wounding twenty. This sparked
                        a wave of anti-U.S. demonstrations throughout China, with multiple attacks
                        on U.S. diplomatic properties, in particular the embassy in Beijing.
                        Tensions eased after an apology from President Bill Clinton and the visit of
                        a special envoy to Beijing. </p>

                        the conditions for entry. Late in the year, after further talks in Beijing,
                        the two sides finally came to an agreement and China was able to join the
