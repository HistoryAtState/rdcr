                <p> The United States and <placeName key="br">Brazil</placeName> have enjoyed long and
                    friendly relations, dating from its years as a Portuguese colony. U.S. merchant
                    ships frequented Brazilian ports such as Pernambuco (now Recife), Bahia (now
                    Salvador), and Rio de Janeiro, and U.S. Consulates appeared in the ports of
                    <placeName key="pernambuco">Pernambuco</placeName> and <placeName key="rio-de-janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</placeName> in the 1810s. Since Brazil’s
                    independence the United States and Brazil have had good relations, and at the
                    beginning of the twentieth century the U.S.-Brazilian relationship was sometimes
                    characterized as "the unwritten alliance." During World War II Brazil sent the
                    Brazilian Expeditionary Force to assist the U.S.-led Italian Campaign. Since
                    World War II, as Brazil has emerged as a regional power and an important leader
                    in international affairs, the United States and Brazil have enjoyed friendly,
                    strong, and active relations, encompassing a broad political and economic
                    agenda. </p>
