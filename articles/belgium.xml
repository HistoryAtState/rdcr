                <p>The <placeName>Kingdom of Belgiu</placeName>m declared its independence from the
                        <placeName>Kingdom of the Netherlands</placeName> on October 4, 1830. Most
                    of the European powers recognized de facto independence on December 20, 1830.
                    However, it was not until the Netherlands signed the Treaty of London on April
                    19, 1839 that the former ruler recognized Brussels as a sovereign state. Belgium
                    had attempted to remain a neutral country for much of its history; however, the
                    German invasions in the first and second World Wars made this impossible. Today,
                    Belgium is a member of the European Union and NATO.</p>
