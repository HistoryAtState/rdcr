                    Barbuda’s location near maritime transport lanes, the <placeName>U.S. Virgin
                        Islands</placeName> and <placeName>Puerto Rico</placeName> make it an
                    attractive site for international drug trafficking, the United States and
                    Antigua and Barbuda established a series of counter-narcotic and counter-crime
                    treaties and agreements in the 1990s.<figure>
