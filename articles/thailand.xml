                <p>Thailand was one of the only countries in South and Southeast Asia that avoided
                    colonization during the nineteenth century. The United States and <placeName
                        xml:id="th">Thailand</placeName>’s first official diplomatic interaction
                    occurred in 1833 when they signed a Treaty of Amity and Commerce, which was the
                    United States’ first treaty with an Asian country. Since the end of World War
                    II, the United States and Thailand have developed close relations. <figure>
