                <p>Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in <date when="1979">1979</date>,
                    the <placeName>United States</placeName> supported both the Afghan resistance
                    fighters and diplomatic efforts to achieve a Soviet withdrawl. As the Taliban
                    rose to national authority in the post-Soviet power vacuum they provided
                    sanctuary for <persName>Osama bin Laden</persName>. Following the Taliban’s
                    repeated refusal to expel bin Laden and his associates and end its support for
                    international terrorism, the United States and its coalition partners began a
                    military campaign on <date when="2001-10-07">October 7, 2001</date>, that
                    targeted terrorist facilities and Taliban military and political assets.
