                    <p>The United States recognized the <placeName>Somali Republic</placeName> on
                        July 1, 1960, in a congratulatory message from President <persName>Dwight D.

                            Osman</persName>. The Somali Republic was formed by the union of
                        Somalia, which previously had been under Italian administration as a United
                        Nations trust territory, and Somaliland, which had been a British
                        protectorate until June 26, 1960.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. Embassy closed on January 5, 1991, and all U.S. personnel were
                        withdrawn after the collapse of the central Somali government; however, the
                        United States did not sever diplomatic relations with Somalia. Through the
                        U.S. Embassy in <placeName>Nairobi</placeName>, Kenya, the United States
                        maintained regular dialogue with transitional governments and other key
                        stakeholders in Somalia, and after January 17, 2013, with the newly
                        recognized central government of Somalia.</p>
