                <p>U.S. diplomatic interaction with Turkey dates back to the days when <placeName
                        xml:id="tr">Turkey</placeName> was known as the Ottoman Empire. After they
                    established diplomatic relations in 1831, the states maintained a diplomatic
                    relationship until <ref target="/milestones/1914-1920/wwi">U.S. entry into World
                        War I</ref> on April 20, 1917. After World War I, the Ottoman Empire
                    dissolved, and in its place arose the modern state of Turkey, with which the
                    United States reestablished relations in 1927. <figure>

                    <p>The first formal act of diplomatic engagement and recognition between the
                        Ottoman Empire (Turkey) and the United States, both long established states,
                        occurred on February 11, 1830, when a U.S. negotiating team comprised of
                        Captain <persName>James Biddle</persName>, <persName>David
                        Offley</persName>, and <persName>Charles Rhind</persName> presented their
                        credentials to the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs. Biddle, Offley, and
                        Rhind negotiated a treaty of navigation and commerce between the United
                        States and Turkey.</p>
