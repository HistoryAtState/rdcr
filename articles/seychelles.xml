                <p>The United States has maintained uninterrupted relations with <placeName key="sc"
                        >Seychelles</placeName> since it’s independence from Great Britain in 1976.
                    Since 1996, however, with the closing of the U.S. Embassy and an Air Force
                    Tracking Station, the U.S. Government no longer maintains an official presence
                    within Seychelles. At present, diplomatic and consular relations with Seychelles
                    are conducted through the U.S. Embassy in Mauritius.</p>

                    <p>The United States recognized the <placeName>Seychelles</placeName> on June
                        29, 1976, when representatives of the two states signed an agreement
                        relating to the establishment, operation, and maintenance of a tracking and

                        The agreement was signed at the capital, <placeName key="victoria"
                            >Victoria</placeName>, on the same date that the Seychelles attained
                        independence from British sovereignty.</p>
