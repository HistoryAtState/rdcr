                <p>When the United States announced its independence from Great Britain in 1776,
                        <placeName xml:id="xy">Mecklenburg-Schwerin</placeName> was a sovereign,
                    independent duchy. Although it joined the Confederation of the Rhine in 1808, it
                    later joined the states allied against Napoleon. Following the Congress of
                    Vienna in 1815, Mecklenburg-Schwerin was elevated to a grand duchy and joined
                    the German Confederation. Although it was a separate and independently sovereign
                    state from its neighbor, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, both Mecklenburgs shared the same
                    diet and constitution.</p>
                <p>The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the United States mutually recognized
                    each other in 1816, but diplomatic relations between the two states were never
                    established. In the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, Mecklenburg-Schwerin sided with
                    Prussia and subsequently joined the North German Confederation. In 1871,
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin became part of the German Empire. From this point forward,
                    foreign policy of the German Empire was made in Berlin, with the German Kaiser
                    (who was also the King of Prussia) accrediting ambassadors of foreign nations.
                    Relations with Imperial Germany were severed when the U.S. declared war in
                    1917.</p>
