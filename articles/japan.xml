                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>Beginning in the early 19th century, American merchants in
                        <placeName>China</placeName> became interested in extending their activities
                    to Japan. At this time, however, the shoguns that ruled Japan had implemented a
                    policy of closed borders that made it very difficult for U.S. citizens and the
                    Japanese to interact. There were, however, isolated cases of interaction. By the
                    1850s, a combination of growing U.S. interests in expanding a regional presence
                    and internal shifts in Japan brought about a dramatic opening in U.S.-Japanese
                    relations.</p>

                    <p>The United States and Japan granted each other formal recognition on March
                        31, 1854 when Special Ambassador of the United States to Japan
                            <persName>Matthew C. Perry</persName> and Japanese representatives
                        signed a Treaty of Peace and Amity at <placeName key="kanagawa">Kanagawa,
                            Japan</placeName>. On July 8, 1853, Commodore Perry had sailed into the
                        harbor of Japan’s capital of Edo (now Tokyo) and delivered a letter from
                        President Millard Fillmore to the Emperor of Japan announcing that the
                        United States sought to open relations with Japan and that Perry would
                        return later to do so. However, this letter did not carry the force of
                        formal recognition, which had to wait until the treaty of 1854.</p>
