                <head>Summary</head>
                <p> Prior to 1971, the Trucial Sheikdoms of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharja, Ajman, Umm
                    al-Qaiwain, Fujairah, and Ras al-Khaimah were under a British protectorate. As
                    such, the Untied States had a very limited relationship with the sheikdoms.
                    Relations became more regular when these sheikdoms formed the <placeName xml:id="ae">United Arab
                        Emirates</placeName> and gained independence in 1971. Since then, relations became more
                    regular and have grown stronger over the years.</p>
