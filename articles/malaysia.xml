                        >Federation of Malaya</placeName> go back to the 19th century, when U.S.
                    merchants traded at several Malaysian ports. However, it was not until the 20th
                    century, particularly after Malaysian independence in 1957, that U.S.-Malaysian
                    relations grew beyond this small-scale commerce.</p>
