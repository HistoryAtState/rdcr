                    Palau began the process of independence and gained it in 1994. The United States
                    recognized Palau at the same time that the trusteeship ended. The United States

                    <p>On September 27, 1994, U.S. President <persName>William Clinton</persName>
                        issued proclamation 6726, noting that as of that day the United States had
                        fulfilled its obligations to Palau under the terms of the Trusteeship
                        Agreement. Therefore, as of October 1, 1994, Palau would no longer be under
                        U.S. trusteeship, and a Compact of Free Association agreed on between the
                        two countries would go into force. This latter date marks U.S. recognition
                        of Palau’s independence.</p>
