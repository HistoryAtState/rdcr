                <p>Following both French and Spanish rule from as early as the 16th century, the
                    island nation of the Dominican Republic declared itself an independent nation
                    from neighboring <placeName>Haiti</placeName> in 1844. In 1861, the Dominican
                    Republic reverted to Spanish rule, again winning its independence in 1865. U.S.
                    military occupations of the Dominican Republic have at times strained relations
                    between the two nations.</p>
