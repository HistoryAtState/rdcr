                <p>British colonial rule was established in <placeName key="lc">St.
                        Lucia</placeName> in <date when="1815">1815</date>. The island grew
                    increasingly self-reliant throughout the twentieth century, participating in the
                    West Indies Federation from 1958 until its collapse in 1962. Along with the
                    other Windward Islands, St. Lucia became a federated state associated with the
                        <placeName>United Kingdom</placeName> in 1967. Although it achieved
                    independence in 1979, St. Lucia remains a member of the British
                    Commonwealth.</p>
                <p>Today the United States and St. Lucia enjoy cooperative relations and have signed
                    several treaties concerning international crime and narcotics trafficking. <figure>
