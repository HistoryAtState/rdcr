                <p>The United States established diplomatic relations with <placeName xml:id="tg"
                        >Togo</placeName> in 1960. It has maintained friendly relations with Togo
                    since its independence from France. Although the United States does not have any
                    significant economic ties to Togo, it nonetheless maintains a strong presence
                    there, most notably in the form of the Peace Corps, in order to encourage
                    economic and rural development.</p>
