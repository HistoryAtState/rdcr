                <p>Honduras joined the Federation of Central American States that included
                    Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and El Salvador two years following its 1821
                    independence from Spain. In the 1900s, U.S. companies established banana
                    plantations throughout Honduras that dominated the economy. Honduras has
                    supported U.S. policy in its neighboring countries of Nicaragua and El
                    Salvador.</p>

                            Canaz</persName> as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary.
                        The Federation consisted of the States of Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua,
                        Costa Rica, and Salvador. After the breakup of the Federation from
                        1838-1840, the United States recognized Honduras as a separate, independent
                        state on April 19, 1853, by the appointment of <persName>Solon
                            Borland</persName> as U.S. Envoy Extraordinary and Minister
