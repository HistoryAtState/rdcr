                <p>The United States recognized <placeName key="sa">Saudi Arabia</placeName> in 1931
                    and signed a provisional agreement regarding diplomatic and consular
                    representation in 1933. The first permanent diplomatic mission and full
                    diplomatic relations between the countries were established in 1940, with the
                    Kingdom’s acceptance of <ref target="/departmenthistory/people/fish-bert">Bert
                        Fish</ref> as American Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. The

                    was elevated to an Embassy in 1949. In 1984, the Jeddah embassy became a U.S.
                    consulate general when the embassy was relocated to <placeName key="riyadh"
                        >Riyadh</placeName>. The U.S. consulate general in <placeName key="dhahran"
