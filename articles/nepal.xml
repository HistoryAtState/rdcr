                <p>The United States and <placeName key="np">Nepal</placeName> have enjoyed friendly
                    relations since the United States first recognized Nepal in 1947. Since 1951,
                    the United States has provided Nepal with economic aid. In recent years, U.S.
                    aid to Nepal is geared toward economic development and ensuring the viability of
                    Nepal’s democratic institutions following the abolition of the Nepalese
                    monarchy, the creation of a representative government, and the end of a 10 year
                    Maoist insurgency in 2006.</p>
