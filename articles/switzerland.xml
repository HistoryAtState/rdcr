                <p>The Congress of Vienna of 1815 re-established the independence and neutrality of
                        <placeName key="ch">Switzerland</placeName>. Since the 1820s the United
                    States and Switzerland have enjoyed consular relations. In 1847, the United
                    States and Switzerland concluded a Convention on the Disposal of Property, and
                    in 1853 the United States established a Legation in Switzerland.<figure>
