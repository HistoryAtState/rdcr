                            independent state on July 4, 1946, when President <persName>Harry S.
                                Truman</persName> did so in a proclamation. The United States and
                            the Philippines signed a treaty on the same date whereby the United
                            States renounced all claims to the Philippines, which had previously
                            been under American sovereignty.</p>
