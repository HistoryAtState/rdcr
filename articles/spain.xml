                <p>The Continental Congress of the United States of America sent <persName>John
                        Jay</persName> to <placeName key="es">Spain</placeName> in 1779 in an
                    attempt to convince the Spanish Court to recognize the new nation. Jay spent two
                    years there to no success. <placeName key="madrid">Madrid</placeName> was
                    unwilling to risk relations with the Congress in Philadelphia until it became
                    apparent that Britain and the United States were actually going to sign a treaty
                    to end the war and recognized U.S. independence. Since 1783, when Spain did
                    eventually recognize the United States, the two countries have broken relations
                    just once, when they went to war against each other in the <ref

                        <p>Future Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court John Jay was appointed
                            Minister Plenipotentiary on September 29, 1779, and proceeded to Madrid
                            shortly thereafter. However, he was never formally received by the
                            Spanish Court due to the intricacies of Spanish involvement in the war
                            against Great Britain at the time. The Spanish did not officially
                            establish diplomatic relations with the United States until the U.S.
