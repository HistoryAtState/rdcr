                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>Occupied by the Russian empire since the end of the 18th century, Belarus
                    declared a short-lived National Republic on March 25, 1918 only to be forcibly
                    absorbed by the Bolsheviks into what became the Soviet Union. Occupied by Nazi
                    Germany, Belarus was retaken by Stalin’s Russia in 1944 and remained under
                    Soviet control until declaring its sovereignty on July 27, 1990 and independence
                    from the Soviet Union on August 25, 1991. It has been run by authoritarian
                        President<persName>Alexander Lukashenko</persName> since 1994. Under
                    Lukashenko U.S.-Belarusian relations have remained at a low level, despite
                    efforts with the European Union to set benchmarks for improving Belarus’ human
                    rights and electoral practices. </p>

                            Stewart</ref> was recalled on March 12, 2008 following a threat of
                        expulsion by Belarusian authorities and the recall of Belarus’ Ambassador to
                        the United States. Belarus subsequently voluntarily reduced the staff at its
                        U.S. missions, excluding the mission to the UN, to five persons and demanded
                        the U.S. reciprocate by reducing the U.S. Embassy in <placeName key="minsk">Minsk</placeName> to five diplomats. When the U.S. refused to comply,
                        Belarusian authorities expelled several U.S. diplomats to reduce U.S.
                        Embassy staffing to five diplomats. </p>
