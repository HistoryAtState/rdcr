                <p> Before 1950, citizens of the United States had, at most, very limited relations
                    with residents of what is today the nation of <placeName key="la">Laos</placeName>. Relations became more regular only after Laos gained its
                    independence from the French Empire following World War II </p>

                    <p>The United States recognized the Kingdom of Laos on February 7, 1950, when
                        the U.S. Department of State made an announcement to that effect. Laos
                        previously had been a Protectorate of France and had become an independent
                        state as part of the French Union in 1949.</p>
