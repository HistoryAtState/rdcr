                <p> United States interactions with the Sultanate of <placeName key="om">Oman</placeName> in the 1830s were some of America’s earliest official
                    dealings with the Middle East. Relations were sporadic over the next century and
                    a half, but became more regular following the appointment of the first U.S.
                    Ambassador to Oman in 1972.</p>

                    <p> The first formal act of diplomatic engagement and recognition between the
                        United States and the Sultanate of Oman occurred on September 21, 1833, when
                        a bilateral treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed at Muscat by Special
                        Agent <persName>Edmund Roberts</persName> and His Majesty <persName>Seyed
                            Syeed bin Sultan</persName> of Muscat. </p>
