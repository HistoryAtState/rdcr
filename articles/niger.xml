                <head>Summary</head>
                <p>U.S. relations with <placeName key="ne">Niger</placeName> have generally been
                    close and friendly since Niger attained independence. The U.S. Peace Corps
                    program in Niger, which started in 1962, currently has about 130 volunteers in
                    country and celebrated its 45th anniversary in September 2007. Although USAID
                    does not have a Mission in Niger, $30 million in annual official aid is
                    administered through American and local non-governmental organizations. Niger
                    maintains a special relationship with France and enjoys close relations with its
                    West African neighbors. It is a charter member of the African Union and the West
                    African Monetary Union and also belongs to the Niger River and Lake Chad Basin
                    Commissions, the Economic Community of West African States, the Nonaligned
                    Movement, and the Organization of the Islamic Conference.</p>
