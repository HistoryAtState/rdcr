                <p>Following the independence of the Commonwealth of Dominica in 1978, the United
                    States established friendly bilateral relations with the former British colony.
                    The United States maintained diplomatic relations with Dominica as political
                    discontent stemming from long-term domestic economic problems led to the
                    establishment of an interim government in 1979.<figure>
