                        Micronesia</placeName>, along with several other island nations, were part
                    of the U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, under U.S. administration.
                    Micronesia achieved independence in 1986. The United States recognized
                    Micronesia upon independence and maintains an embassy in <placeName

                    <p>The United States recognized Micronesian independence on November 3, 1986,
                        when U.S. President <persName>Ronald Reagan</persName> noted in proclamation
                        5564 that the United States had fulfilled its obligations to Micronesia
                        under the terms of the trusteeship agreement. Therefore, effective that day,
                        the Federated States of Micronesia would no longer be under U.S.
                        trusteeship, and a Compact of Free Association agreed upon between the two
                        countries would go into force.</p>
