                    signing a treaty negotiated by Benjamin Franklin. Diplomatic relations were
                    established in 1818 and have remained unbroken since that time.<figure>

                    <p>Sweden recognized the United States on April 3, 1783, when the Treaty of
                        Amity and Commerce between the United States and Sweden was signed in
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>The United States had appointed <ref target="/departmenthistory/people/franklin-benjamin">Benjamin
                        Franklin</ref> as Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden on September 28,
                        1782. Franklin did not proceed to Sweden, but remained in Paris, where he
                        was already serving as Minister Plenipotentiary to France. The Swedish
                        minister in Paris approached Franklin in 1782 with the suggestion of
                        concluding a treaty between the two entities, remarking that he hoped it
                        would be remembered that <quote>“Sweden was the first power in Europe which
                            had voluntarily and without solicitation offered its friendship to the
                            United States.” </quote>Franklin informed Congress of this initiative
                        and was then empowered to negotiate with Sweden. </p>
