                <p>Under Spanish colonial rule for most of the modern era, Equatorial Guinea gained
                    independence in 1968. At the time of independence, Equatorial Guinea had one of
                    the highest per capita incomes and the highest literacy rates in Africa. Since
                    independence, Equatorial Guinea has attracted investment from U.S. companies and
                    the United States Government. With the increased U.S. investment presence,
                    relations between the U.S. and the Government of Equatorial Guinea have been
                    characterized by a positive, constructive relationship. <figure>
