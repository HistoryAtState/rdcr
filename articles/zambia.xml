                <p>The United States and <placeName xml:id="zm">Zambia</placeName> have enjoyed good
                    relations since Zambia’s independence from Great Britain. Despite high levels of
                    poverty, Zambia successfully made the transition from one-party rule to
                    democracy in 1991 and provides a safe haven to refuges from throughout Africa,
                    while the United States has sought to bolster Zambia’s prospects through
                    economic and humanitarian assistance.</p>
