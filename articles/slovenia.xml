                <p>The United States and <placeName key="si">Slovenia</placeName> have maintained
                    cordial relations ever since Slovenia won its independence from
                        <placeName>Yugoslavia</placeName> in 1991. In recent years, the United
                    States has sought to promote Slovenia’s future as a vibrant, pluralistic
                    democracy by supporting Slovene membership in organizations such as the North
                    Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union (EU), and the World
                    Trade Organization (WTO), while Slovenia has joined international stabilization
                    efforts within countries such as <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName>.</p>
