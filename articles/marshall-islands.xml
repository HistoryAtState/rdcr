                <p>On June 25, 1983, four years after the Republic of the Marshall Islands became
                    self-governing, the United States and the Marshall Islands began negotiations to
                    sign the Compact of Free Association. On October 21, 1986, the Compact was
                    agreed upon by both nations and entered into force. The Compact ended the U.S.
                    Trusteeship Agreement with the Marshall Islands, giving the nation the right to
                    exercise self-determination, although the U.S. would still be responsible for
                    the defense of the region. In return, the U.S. was granted the continued use of
                    the Kwajalein Atoll for military purposes.</p>

                        Islands’ former status as a United Nations Strategic Trust Territory.</p>
