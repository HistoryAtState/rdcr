                <p>President George H.W. Bush extended recognition to <placeName xml:id="tm"
                        >Turkmenistan</placeName> in 1991 after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
                    Since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the United States has sought closer
                    relations with Turkmenistan. In February 2007, the two countries agreed to find
                    ways to cooperate on political and human rights reform, economic and
                    agricultural reform, education and health care, energy, and security.</p>
