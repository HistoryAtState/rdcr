                <p> Costa Rica was originally part of the United Provinces of Central America, which
                    had separated from <placeName>Mexico</placeName> in 1823. Although the United
                    Provinces had separated into El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and
                    Costa Rica by 1839, Costa Rica did not formally declare its independence until
                    August 30, 1848. </p>

                            5, 1848. On April 24, 1849, <ref target="/departmenthistory/people/squier-ephraim-george">Ephraim G.

                            This latter date constituted recognition by the United States. Squier
