                    <p>The United States recognized the Republic of Liberia on September 23, 1862,
                        when the American Minister to England <persName>Charles F. Adams</persName>
                        was empowered to conclude a treaty of commerce and navigation with the
                        Republic of Liberia. The treaty was signed by Adams and the President of
                        Liberia on October 25, 1862.</p>
                    <p>The state that became Liberia originated in 1822 when the American
                        Colonization Society founded a settlement for freedmen and recaptured
                        slaves. In 1847 the settlement constituted itself as a republic and
                        subsequently was recognized by several European states.</p>
