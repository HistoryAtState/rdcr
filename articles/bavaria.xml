                <p>When the United States announced its independence from Great Britain in 1776,
                        <placeName xml:id="xw"> Bavaria</placeName> was a sovereign, independent
                    state. One of the largest German states (after Austria and Prussia), Bavaria was
                    elevated from an electorate into a kingdom in 1806. In 1808, the King of Bavaria
                    issued a constitution that granted basic rights, freedoms, and religious
                    toleration, and the 1818 constitution established a bicameral legislature named
                    the Stände-Versammlung. The first act of mutual recognition between the United
                    States and the Kingdom of Bavaria occurred in 1833 and relations between the two
                    countries expanded through 1871 when Bavaria joined the German Empire. From this
                    point forward, foreign policy of the German Empire was made in Berlin, with the
                    German Kaiser (who was also the King of Prussia) accrediting ambassadors of
                    foreign nations. Relations were severed when the U.S. declared war upon Imperial
                    Germany in 1917.</p>

                    <p> The first known act of mutual recognition between the United States and the
                        Kingdom of Bavaria was the establishment of a U.S. Consulate in Bavaria. A
                        letter from U.S. Consul <persName>Robert de Ruedorffer</persName> dated July
                        4, 1833, informs U.S. Secretary of State <ref target="/departmenthistory/people/livingston-edward">Edward
                            Livingston</ref> that Ruedorffer will discharge the duties of Consul for

                    <p>The relationship between the United States and the Kingdom of Bavaria
                        continued to expand through the 1860s. On May 26, 1868, specially accredited
                        U.S. Minister Plenipotentiary <persName>George Bancroft</persName> signed a
                        naturalization treaty with Bavaria. At the time, Bancroft was also
                        accredited to Prussia and the North German Confederation and, after 1871, to
                        the German Empire. Yet, although Bancroft was recalled from his position in
                        Berlin in 1874 (at his own request), he was never officially recalled from
                        the court of Bavaria. In 1895, four years after his death, Bancroft still
                        “officially stood as the diplomatic representative of the United States to
                        Bavaria.” (See entry on <ref target="/countries/issues/german-unification">German Unification</ref> for greater details.) </p>

                    <p>On February 3, 1917, U.S. President <persName>Woodrow Wilson</persName>
                        instructed the Secretary of State to notify the German Ambassador to the
                        United States that all diplomatic relations between the U.S. and the German
                        Empire were severed. As the foreign affairs of Imperial Germany were run out
                        of Berlin and decided upon by the Kaiser, this constituted the severance of
                        relations with Bavaria, as part of the German Empire. On April 6, 1917,
                        Wilson declared war upon Imperial Germany.</p>

                    <head>The Second Reich, Trade, Citizenship, and Extradition.</head>
                    <p>As with all of the German states that the United States had treaties with,
                        after Bavaria joined the Second Reich in 1871 there were questions as to
                        whether U.S. officials abided by treaties concluded with Bavaria or with
                        Prussia in dealing with issues of trade, citizenship, or extradition with
                        subjects of the Kingdom of Bavaria. It was decided that a variety of
                        different circumstances would guide U.S. foreign policy towards German
                        states. First, “where a State has lost its separate existence, as in the
                        case of Hanover and Nassau, no questions can arise.” Second, “where no
                        treaty has been negotiated with the Empire, the treaties with the various
                        States which have preserved a separate existence have been resorted to.” </p>
                    <p> Despite the Constitution of the German Empire of 1871, which stipulated that
                        the Empire was responsible for treaties, alliances, and representing the
                        Empire amongst nations, the smaller states still retained the right of
                        legation. This included the right to legislate, to grant exequaturs to
                        foreign consuls in their territories (though not to send German consuls
                        abroad), and to enter into conventions with foreign nations as long as they
                        did not concern matters already within the jurisdiction of the Empire or the
                        Emperor. </p>
