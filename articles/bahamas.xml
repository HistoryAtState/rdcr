                <p>As a close neighbor of the United States, The Bahamas has historically enjoyed
                    good diplomatic relations with the United States. Since achieving full
                    independence from the United Kingdom in 1973, The Bahamas has closely cooperated
                    with the United States to reduce drug trafficking and illegal immigration
                    issues. <figure>
