                <p>The United States has traditionally maintained amicable relations with <placeName
                        key="sl">Sierra Leone</placeName>. It also supported international efforts
                    to end a brutal, decade-long civil war in Sierra Leone, and prevent the illegal
                    sale of diamonds from that country. At present, the United States is seeking
                    promote peace and stability in Sierra Leone by providing economic and
                    humanitarian aid.</p>
