                    <p>The United States and the Kingdom of Choson (Korea) engaged in their first
                        official diplomatic interaction on May 22, 1882, when representatives of the
                        two states signed a treaty of amity and commerce at Chemulpo, Korea. The
                        treaty had been negotiated with the assistance of Chinese officials, since
                        China had for many years had influence in Korea’s foreign affairs due to a
                        historical tributary relationship between the two countries. In fact, Korea
                        was an independent state and this fact was acknowledged in the treaty. It
                        was the first treaty Korea signed with a Western nation.</p>
