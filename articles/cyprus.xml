                <p> The island of Cyprus had been a British Crown Colony since 1925, but in 1960, it
                    received its independence. The United States recognized Cyprus on August 16,
                    1960. In 1983, a Turkish-controlled area located on the northern section of the
                    island declared its independence, calling itself the Turkish Republic of
                    Northern Cyprus (TRNC). <placeName>Turkey</placeName> has been the only country
                    in the world to recognize the TRNC, however. Although the United States has
                    never recognized the TRNC, it has consistently maintained its diplomatic
                    relations with Cyprus since 1960. </p>
