                        Marsh in April 1850 and offered to ask his government for authority to
                        negotiate such a treaty. The treaty, finalized in November 1851, failed to
                        go into effect when the Persian government took no action on a
                        “most-favored-nation” commercial clause added to the treaty by the U.S.

                    <p>The United States severed diplomatic relations with Iran on April 7, 1980.
                        This action was taken following the seizure by student militants of the
                        American Embassy in <placeName key="tehran">Tehran</placeName> and its staff
                        on November 4, 1979, and the subsequent failure of the Iranian government to
                        secure their release. The hostages eventually were released on January 20,
                        1981; however, diplomatic relations remain severed and Switzerland currently
                        serves as the protecting power for U.S. interests in Iran.</p>
