                <p>Haiti is the second-oldest republic in the Western Hemisphere, after the United
                    States. Though it won independence from <placeName>France</placeName> in 1804,
                    Haiti did not receive U.S. recognition until 1862. Haiti experienced numerous
                    periods of intense political and economic disorder, prompting U.S. military
                    intervention in 1915. Following a 19-year occupation, U.S. military forces were
                    withdrawn in 1934, and Haiti regained sovereign rule.</p>
