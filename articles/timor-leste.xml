                        <p> The United States recognized Timor-Leste, then known as <placeName>East
                            Timor</placeName>, on May 20, 2002, when it achieved formal
                            independence. Before this time, the region had been a Portuguese colony
                            up until 1975 and was under Indonesian sovereignty from 1976 to 1999.
                            After a popular referendum in 1999, held under UN auspices, the
                            International Force for East Timor kept the peace until formal
                            independence was established in 2002. </p>
