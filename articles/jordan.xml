                    <p>The United States recognized the Kingdom of Transjordan as an independent
                        state in a White House announcement on January 31, 1949. Transjordan had
                        been a mandated territory placed under the protection of Great Britain
                        following World War I, and had declared its independence with the agreement
                        of Great Britain on May 25, 1946.</p>
