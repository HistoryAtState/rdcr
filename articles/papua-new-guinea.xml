                    particularly after the establishment of Papua New Guinean independence, that
                    relations began to increase in scope and intensity.</p>

                            New Guinea at its independence ceremonies. The new state of Papua New
                            Guinea was comprised of New Guinea, Papua, which previously had been a
                            Trust Territory administered by Australia, and nearby islands.</p>
