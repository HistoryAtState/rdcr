                <p>At the time of American independence, Algiers was a nominal vassal of the Ottoman
                    Empire with the power to conduct its own independent foreign relations.
                        <placeName key="dz">Algeria</placeName> recognized the United States in
                    1795, although permanent diplomatic relations were not established until after
                    Algeria emerged from subsequent French rule in 1962.<figure>

                    <p>Algerian self-rule ended with French conquest in 1830. In 1848, the French
                        government formally incorporated coastal Algeria into France as the
                        departments of Algiers, Oran, and Constantine.</p>

                    <p>The United States recognized Algeria on July 3, 1962, when President
                            <persName>John Kennedy</persName> issued a congratulatory message to the
                        Algerian people upon their independence from France. Algeria had opted for
                        independence in a referendum on <date when="1962-07-01">July 1, 1962</date>,
                        and France recognized Algeria as an independent state on July 3, 1962.</p>

                    <p>Formal U.S. Consular representation began with <persName>Joel
                            Barlow</persName>’s presentation of his credentials as consul to
                            <persName>Dey Hassan</persName> of <placeName key="algiers"
                            >Algiers</placeName> on March 4, 1796. Prior to Barlow, <persName>John
                            Paul Jones</persName> had been appointed as consul on June 2, 1792, but
                        died before reaching post. <persName>Pierre Eric Skjöldebrand</persName>,
                        brother of the Swedish Consul at <placeName key="algiers"
                            >Algiers</placeName>, worked as an intermediary for the United States in
                        negotiating a peace treaty with Algiers. Consular presence was interrupted
                        from July 25, 1812 until July of 1815 owing to the Algerian War, one of the
                        Barbary Wars. When appointee <persName>David Porter</persName> heard of the
                        French occupation of Algiers in 1830, he chose not to take up his post,
                        instead waiting for a new assignement as Chargé d’Affaires at
                            <placeName>Instanbul</placeName>, where he arrived in 1831. There is no
                        extant consul until the arrival of <persName>George F. Brown</persName> in
                            <date when="1835">1835</date>, whose exequatur was revoked in 1838. The
