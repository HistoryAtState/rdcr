                <p>In 1814, the Treaty of Kiel transferred Norway from Danish to Swedish rule.
                    Denmark had sided with <persName>Napoleon</persName>, while Sweden had allied
                    itself with Napoleon’s enemies in 1812. Norway accepted union with Sweden under
                    a common monarch, while retaining its own constitution and national assembly.
                    Cultural nationalism led to economic nationalism in the 19th century. <placeName
                        key="no">Norway</placeName> demanded its own national flag and consular
                    service in order to promote its maritime commerce. After Sweden was unwilling to
                    concede these points, Norway’s national assembly (Storting) declared an end to
                    the union with Sweden on June 7, 1905. Sweden accepted, and a treaty of
                    separation was signed on October 26, 1905. Norway chose <persName>Prince Charles
                        of Denmark</persName> as its king, who assumed the name of <persName>Haakon
                        VII</persName> and ruled until 1957.</p>
