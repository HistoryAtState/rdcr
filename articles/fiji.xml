                <p>The United States maintained a consular presence in Fiji before the island chain
                    became a Crown colony within the British Empire in 1874. Fiji gained
                    independence from British rule in October 1970 and established a parliamentary
                    democracy. In 1987, however, intra-country clashes between political parties
                    representing the majority ethnic Fijian population and ethnic minority
                    communities, most notably Indo-Fijian, led to a military coup d’état. This was
                    the beginning of what many now refer to as the “coup cycle.” </p>
