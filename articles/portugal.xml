                    <placeName key="pt">Portugal</placeName> was the first neutral nation to
                    establish diplomatic ties with the United States. The two countries have
                    maintained positive relations since 1791 and share strong defense ties. Portugal
                    is a member of the European Union and NATO.</p>

                            the same year, in Ponta Delgada on the island of Sao Miguel, is the
