                <p>Long isolated, the Ethiopian emperors began to consolidate the country in the
                    mid-nineteenth century. The Italian invasions in 1895 and 1935 forced Ethiopia
                    into greater contact with world politics. U.S.-Ethiopian relations were
                    established in 1903 and were good throughout the period prior to the Italian
                    occupation in 1935.</p>

                <p>After World War II, these ties strengthened and Ethiopia has played an active
                    role in world and African affairs. Following Ethiopia’s revolution,
                    U.S.-Ethiopian relations began to cool due to the Derg’s linking with
                    international communism and U.S. revulsion at the Derg’s human rights abuses.
                    With the downfall of the Mengistu regime in 1991, U.S.-Ethiopian relations
                    improved dramatically. Today, Ethiopia has very good relations with the United
                    States, especially in responding to regional instability and supporting war on
                    terrorism and, increasingly, through economic involvement.</p>
