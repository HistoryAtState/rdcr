                <p>The United States and <placeName key="sz">Swaziland</placeName> have enjoyed
                    cordial relations since the latter’s independence from Great Britain. The United
                    States is currently a major aid donor to Swaziland, and both governments
                    cooperate on matters such as preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.</p>
