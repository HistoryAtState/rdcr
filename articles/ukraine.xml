                <p>The U.S. recognized <placeName xml:id="ua">Ukraine</placeName> after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The
                    United States has traditionally sought to promote Ukrainian political and
                    economic stability since the Ukraine declared independence from Russia. U.S.
                    relations with the Ukraine have, however, been complicated by Ukraine’s
                    historical relationship with Russia. </p>
