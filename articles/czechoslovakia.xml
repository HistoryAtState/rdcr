                <p>The Kingdom of <placeName>Bohemia</placeName> was incorporated into the
                        <placeName>Holy Roman Empire</placeName> during the Thirty Years’ War
                    (1618-48) and came under the domain of the Habsburg monarchs. Czech nationalism
                    grew throughout the nineteenth century as a cultural movement despite the fact
                    that under the Dual Monarchy (1867-1918) Bohemia and Moravia were part of the
                    Austrian Empire while Slovakia was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. U.S.
                    President <persName>Woodrow Wilson</persName> had a significant role in the
                    founding of the Czechoslovakian Republic; thus, since Czechoslovakian
                    independence, the United States and the Czechoslovakian Republic enjoyed close
                    ties. This friendship, however, was strained by the tensions of the Cold War as
                    Czechoslovakian foreign policy from 1948-89 was the prerogative of the
                        <placeName>Soviet Union</placeName>. <figure>

                        announced that the United States recognized the Czecho-Slovak National
                        Council, which was resident in Paris, as a de facto government at war with
                        the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires and that it was prepared to enter
                        into formal relations with it. The Czecho-Slovak National Council organized
                        a Provisional Government on October 14 and declared its independence from
                            <placeName>Austria-Hungary</placeName> on October 18, 1918.</p>

                        A consulate was opened in 1869 and closed April 9, 1917, after

                    <p>The United States opened a Consulate General in Bratislava in 1947. It was
                        closed in 1950 after the Communist Government of Czechoslovakia alleged that
                        U.S. diplomatic personnel were engaged in espionage and other improper
                        activities, and demanded a reduction in their numbers. For the establishment
