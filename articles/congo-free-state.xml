                <p>The Congo Free State was a former state in Africa covering much of the territory
                    that comprises the modern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was created in
                    the 1880s through agreements with local rulers by a group of European investors
                    headed by Leopold II, King of the Belgians.</p>

                        Belgium on November 15, 1908, which ended its existence as an independent
