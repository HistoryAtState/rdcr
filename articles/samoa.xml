                <p>The United States began to interact with what is now <placeName key="ws"
                        >Samoa</placeName> during the first half of the 19th century, when U.S.
                    merchants stopped at the islands on their trips across the Pacific Ocean. Formal
                    relations did not begin until after Samoan independence in the early 1960s. <figure>

                        on January 1, 1962, when Senator <persName>Oren Long</persName> delivered a

                        to Their Excellencies, <persName>Tupua Tamesese Mea’ole</persName> and
