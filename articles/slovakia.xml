                <p>In July 1992, Slovakia declared itself a sovereign state and began negotiations
                    with the <ref target="/countries/czech-republic">Czech Republic</ref> to disband
                    the country that had been <ref target="/countries/czechoslovakia"
                        >Czechoslovakia</ref>. Once parliament approved, on January 1, 1993,
                    Slovakia and the Czech Republic became two separate autonomous countries. The
                    United States formally recognized the establishment of <placeName key="sk"
                        >Slovakia</placeName> on that same date. <figure>

                    <p>On January 1, 1993, the U.S. formally recognized both the Slovak and Czech
                        Republic as separate, sovereign states. A public statement was made
                        indicating that an ambassador to the Slovak Republic would be appointed
                        shortly thereafter.</p>
