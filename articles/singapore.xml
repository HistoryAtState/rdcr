                <p>Informal relations between the United States and <placeName key="sg"
                        >Singapore</placeName> began when U.S. merchants engaged in the
                        <placeName>China</placeName> trade began to visit the port on their way to
                    and from China. As Singapore became one of the most important ports in the
                    region, U.S.-Singaporean interaction increased through the 19th and 20th
                    centuries.</p>

                        <p>On August 11, 1965, the United States recognized the newly independent
                            and sovereign state of Singapore in a letter from Secretary of State
                                <ref target="/departmenthistory/people/rusk-david-dean">Dean

                            sovereignty of the British Empire since the early 19th century. After
                            gaining its independence from the British Empire in 1963, Singapore
                            briefly joined the Federation of Malaysia, before breaking away for
                            independent sovereignty in 1965.</p>
