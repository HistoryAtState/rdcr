                <p>From 1895 until 1963, the area that later became modern Kenya was under British
                    colonial rule as part of British East Africa. In 1998, the American Embassy in
                    Kenya’s capital city <placeName key="nairobi">Nairobi</placeName> was the target
                    of a terrorist bombing that killed 12 U.S. citizens, 32 Foreign Service
                    Nationals (FSNs), and 247 Kenyan citizens. Approximately 5,000 Kenyans, 6 U.S.
                    citizens, and 13 FSNs were injured.</p>
