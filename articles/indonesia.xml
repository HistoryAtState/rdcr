                <p>U.S.-Indonesian interaction has a long history, dating back to the early 19th
                    century when sufficient numbers of U.S. traders and others stopped in the
                    then-Dutch colony to warrant the establishment of a consular post. However,
                    relations remained on an informal level until after Indonesian independence
                    following World War II.</p>
