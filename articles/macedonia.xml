                    <placeName key="mk">Macedonia</placeName> achieved independence in 1991 with the
                    peaceful breakup of Yugoslavia. Recognition was delayed because of Greece’s
                    objection to Macedonia’s use of “Macedonia,” and the country was initially
                    recognized as the “Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.” The United States
                    recognized FRYM in 1994 under the provisional designation and began referring to
                    Macedonia by its constitutional name, Republic of Macedonia, in 2004.</p>
