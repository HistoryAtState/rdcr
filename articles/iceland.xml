                <p>Following the April 9, 1940, German occupation of Denmark, Iceland took control
                    of its own foreign relations. In July and December of that year Icelandic
                    officials asked the United States to place Iceland under U.S. protection in
                    accordance with the <ref target="/milestones/1801-1829/monroe">Monroe
                        Doctrine</ref> to forestall a feared German invasion of the island. The
                    United States was initially unenthusiastic about this proposal, but ultimately
                    concluded that Icelandic occupation was a matter of national defense and
                    occupied Iceland on July 7, 1941.<figure>

                    <p>When German forces occupied <placeName>Denmark</placeName> in 1940, Iceland
                        assumed control over its own foreign affairs and gradually moved toward
                        complete independence from Denmark. Following a plebiscite, Iceland formally
                        became an independent republic on <date when="1944-06-17">June 17,
                            1944</date>. That same day, the United States recognized Iceland in

                            declared itself independent from Denmark, which was then under German
                            occupation.</p>
