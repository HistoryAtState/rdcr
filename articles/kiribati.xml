                <p>The United States established a consular presence at <placeName key="butaritari"
                        >Butaritari</placeName> in the Gilbert Islands (present-day Kiribati) to
                    protect U.S. trade in the region, appointing Commercial Agent <persName>Adolph
                        Rick</persName> on May 25, 1888. With the Ellice Islands (present-day
                        <placeName>Tuvalu</placeName>), the Gilbert Islands became a British
                    protectorate in 1892 and the entire island group was made a British colony in
                    1916.</p>
                <p>The Japanese occupied several of the Gilbert Islands during World War II, after
                    which the island chain reverted to its former colonial status. The British began
                    expanding self-government in the islands during the 1960s, clearing the way for
                    the Gibert and Ellice Islands splitting in 1975. Kiribati eventually became
                    independent on July 12, 1979. <figure>

                    <p>The United States recognized the Republic of Kiribati (formerly the Gilbert
                        Islands) on September 20, 1979, when the two nations signed a Treaty of
                        Friendship. The Gilbert Islands, previously a British colony, had gained
                        independence on July 12, 1979, under the name of Kiribati.</p>
