                <p>After several colonial and military occupations, <placeName key="nr"
                        >Nauru</placeName> became a United Nations trust territory following World
                    War II. The country achieved independence in 1968, and several years later the
                    United States accredited its Ambassador to Australia to also serve Nauru. The
                    United States does not have an embassy in the <placeName key="yaren-district"
                        >Yaren District</placeName>; today, the U.S. Ambassador to Fiji is
                    accredited to Nauru.</p>
