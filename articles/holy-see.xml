                <p>The Holy See is the diplomatic representative of the Roman Catholic Church and
                    the Pope with its headquarters in <placeName key="vatican-city">Vatican
                        City</placeName>. The United States maintained a presence in Rome throughout
                    the nineteenth century. The United States at different times had a Minister to
                    the Papal States, Minister to the Pontifical States, and finally, a Minister to
                    Rome from 1848 until Kingdom of Italy conquered Rome in 1870. Throughout much of
                    the twentieth century, successive U.S. Presidents sent a Personal Representative
                    to the Holy See.</p>
