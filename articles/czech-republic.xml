                <p>Czechia was established on January 1, 1993, out of the former Czech
                    and Slovak Federal Republic (commonly known as <ref target="/countries/czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</ref>) which ceased to
                    exist as of December 31, 1992. Since independence, the Czechs have made
                    integration into Western institutions their chief foreign policy objective and
                    are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union
                    (EU). Relations between the U.S. and Czechia are excellent and
                    reflect the common approach both have to the many challenges facing the world at present.<figure>
