                <p>Prior to the 1980s, citizens of the United States had only very occasional
                    contact with residents of the <placeName>Pacific islands</placeName> that
                    comprise what is now the Republic of <placeName xml:id="vu"

                        <p>The United States recognized the Republic of Vanuatu soon after it gained
                            its independence on July 30, 1980, when President <persName>Jimmy Carter
                            </persName>sent a message to that effect to the Government of Vanuatu.
                            Vanuatu previously had been under the joint sovereignty of a condominium
                            between <placeName>France</placeName> and the <placeName>United
                                Kingdom</placeName>.</p>

                        <p>The United States established diplomatic relations with Vanuatu on
                            September 30, 1986, when representatives of both states signed an
                            agreement to that effect.</p>

                            Ambassadorial relations commenced when U.S. Ambassador to Papua New

                                E. Bierman</ref> presented his credentials to the Government of
                            Vanuatu on April 10, 1987. Since that time, the Ambassadors to Vanuatu
                            have also been accredited to <placeName>Papua New Guinea</placeName> and
                            the <placeName>Solomon Islands</placeName> and have been resident at
