                <p>Denmark and the United States have never experienced an interruption in their
                    diplomatic relations since they were first established in 1801. In 1917, Denmark
                    sold the Danish West Indies in the Caribbean Sea to the United States; the
                    islands are now known as the <placeName>U.S. Virgin Islands</placeName>. </p>
                <p>Since its liberation in 1945, Denmark has been one of the United States’ closest
                    allies. A founding-member of both the United Nations and the North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization, in recent years Denmark has also been an energetic
                    supporter of U.S. policy in Iraq and Afghanistan, and hosts the vital
                    early-warning radar facility in Thule, Greenland. U.S.-Danish relations are also
                    strengthened by the fact that the United States is currently Denmark’s largest
                    non-European trading partner. </p>

                    <p> The U.S. Legation at Copenhagen was closed on December 20, 1941, following
                        the outbreak of war between the United States and Germany. German forces had
                        occupied the city on April 9, 1940 and U.S. Minister <ref target="/departmenthistory/people/atherton-ray">Ray Atherton</ref> left
                        Copenhagen on June 5, 1940. Atherton subsequently took up residence in
                        Ottawa, Ontario, Canada as U.S. Minister to Denmark’s government, which
                        remained in Danish hands until German authorities seized complete control in
                        August 1943.</p>
