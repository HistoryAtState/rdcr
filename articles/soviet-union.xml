                <p>The 1917 Russian Revolution overthrew the old Russian Empire, which had
                    recognized the United States in 1803 and established diplomatic relations in
                    1809. Normal diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia were
                    interrupted in 1917 and were resumed on November 16, 1933, when President
                    Franklin Roosevelt informed Soviet Foreign Minister <persName>Maxim Litvinov</persName> that the
                    United States recognized the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist
                    Republics (USSR) and wished to establish normal diplomatic relations. Litvinov on the
                    same day replied that his government was glad to establish normal diplomatic
                    relations and exchange ambassadors. With the dissolution of the USSR in
                    1991, the United States considered the Russian Federation as the successor state
                    of the USSR. Please view the country entry for <ref target="/countries/russia">Russia</ref>. </p>
