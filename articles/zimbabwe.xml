                <p>The United States was the first country to establish an embassy in <placeName
                        xml:id="zw">Zimbabwe</placeName> following its creation in 1980. Since then,
                    the United States has provided humanitarian relief and encouraged the holding of
                    free, democratic elections that would allow for an end to international
                    sanctions and the return of direct foreign investment to Zimbabwe.</p>
