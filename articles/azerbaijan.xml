                <p>Located at the crossroads of European-Asian trading routes, <placeName key="az">Azerbaijan</placeName> was fought over by Russian, Persian and Ottoman
                    forces for centuries. After the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917,
                    Azerbaijan briefly became an independent state that was de facto recognized by
                    the Allies in January 1920, only to have independence terminated when the Red
                    Army arrived in April of that year. </p>

                <p> Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the United States and Azerbaijan
                    have established bilateral relations. The United States has paid special
                    attention to encouraging peaceful, negotiated resolution to Azeri-Armenian
                    territorial conflicts. </p>
