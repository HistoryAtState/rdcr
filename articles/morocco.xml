                    <placeName key="ma">Morocco</placeName> formally recognized the United States by
                    signing a treaty of peace and friendship in 1786. Despite a longstanding
                    consular presence, permanent diplomatic relations did not begin until 1905.
                    Morocco entered into the status of a French protectorate from 1912 to 1956, and
                    normal diplomatic relations were resumed after U.S. recognition of Moroccan
                    independence in 1956.<figure>

                    <p>In 1912, Morocco became a French protectorate. Certain portions of Morocco
                        also came under Spanish control, including the province of Tangier. However,
                        the United States did not recognize the French and Spanish protectorates
                        until October 20, 1917, when Secretary of State <persName>Robert
                            Lansing</persName> sent a letter formally acknowledging the protectorate
                        to <persName>Jean Jules Jusserand</persName>, French Ambassador to the

                        to assume his duties and establish the U.S. consulate. Simpson served for
                        over twenty years, until his death on March 8, 1820. In 1821, as a gift to
                        the United States, Sultan Mawlay Suleiman gave a building for the
                        consulate’s use, which was the first property abroad owned by the United
                        States. The building is now the Tangier American Legation Institute for
                        Moroccan Studies (TALIM).</p>
