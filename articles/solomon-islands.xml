                <p>Relations between the United States and what is now the <placeName key="sb"
                        >Solomon Islands</placeName> began in the late 19th century, when U.S.
                    vessels began stopping at the islands. During World War II they became the site
                    of intense battles between U.S. and Japanese forces, particularly on the island
                    of <placeName key="guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</placeName>. Relations remained
                    mostly informal until after the Solomon Islands gained their independence in
                    1978.</p>
