                <p> Prior to 1971, the United States had a very limited relationship with what is
                    today the State of <placeName key="qa">Qatar</placeName>. Relations became more
                    regular following Qatar’s independence after years as a British
                    protectorate.</p>

                        <p> The United States recognized the State of Qatar on September 5, 1971,
                            when the Department of State made an announcement to that effect. Qatar
                            had previously been a protectorate under Great Britain, declaring
                            independence on September 3, 1971, following the termination date of
                            treaties with Great Britain. </p>
